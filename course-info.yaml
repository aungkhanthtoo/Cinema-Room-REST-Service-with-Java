title: Cinema Room REST Service with Java
language: English
summary: "<p>Always wanted to have your private movie theater and screen only the\
  \ movies you like? You can buy a fancy projector and set it up in a garage, but\
  \ how can you sell tickets? The idea of a ticket booth is old-fashioned, so let's\
  \ create a special service for that! Make good use of Spring and write a REST service\
  \ that can show the available seats, sell and refund tickets, and display the statistics\
  \ of your venue. Pass me the popcorn, please!\r\n</p>"
